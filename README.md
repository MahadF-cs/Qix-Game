# Qix Remastered

As a team of 4, in only a month, we recreated the classic arcade game "Qix" with a modern tile and sprite system, all in Python with the Pygame library. I was in charge of writing the game's more complex algorithms, organizing the code in an OOP format, and creating the game's sprites

The game is complete and a playable _.exe_ is coming soon
